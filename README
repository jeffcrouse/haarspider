INTRODUCTION
----------------
Speed project created on a slow Tuesday morning from 11am-3pm.



REQUIREMENTS
----------------
LibCURL		http://curl.haxx.se/
pcrecpp		http://www.pcre.org/
OpenCV		http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/



EXAMPLE USAGE
---------------
haarspider --url http://www.cnn.com --levels 2 --max 1000 --profile cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml --out cnnfaces.jpg

This will:
1. find all images on cnn.com and find faces in them
2. find all of the links on cnn.com and find all of the faces on those pages.  
3. Go back to 1 (depending on how many levels you specify)


Press 'o' at any time to output an image.

INSTALL
---------------
There is no configure script, so all you have to do is:

make


TO DO
--------------
- command line args for maximum and min image size to consider
- specify output image size
- press 'o' at any time to output image
- other options to create a squarepacked (or circlepacked) image rather than an average
- output elapsed time
- verbose doesn't really do anything
