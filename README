INTRODUCTION
----------------
Speed project created on a slow Tuesday morning from 11am-3pm.



REQUIREMENTS
----------------
LibCURL		http://curl.haxx.se/
pcrecpp		http://www.pcre.org/
OpenCV		http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/



EXAMPLE USAGE
---------------
haarspider --url http://www.cnn.com --levels 2 --max 1000 --profile cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml --out cnnfaces.jpg

This will:
1. find all images on cnn.com and find faces in them
2. find all of the links on cnn.com and find all of the faces on those pages.  
3. Go back to 1 (depending on how many levels you specify)


INSTALL
---------------
There is no configure script, so all you have to do is:

make


FAQ
-------------
1. In the XCode project, why is all of the OpenCV stuff linked to $(SRCROOT)/OpenCV-2.2.0 ?
Cuz that's how I like it.  Try it out -- you might like it too. Go into the directory, open a terminal and type:

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencvlibrary/opencv-unix/2.2/OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2
tar -xvf OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2
cd  OpenCV-2.2.0
ccmake -G Xcode .

In the ccmake interactive console, you should see a "EMPTY CACHE" at the top of the console window. Hit 'c' to create an initial configuration. Once that's done, use the arrow keys to move down the list, enter to change a value. 

Hit 'c' to reconfigure for the new settings, then 'g'.  That will create OpenCV-2.2.0/OpenCV.xcodeproj.  Open that XCode project and build!  Easy! And for debugging, your libraries are linked to the cource code, so you can track down errors easily.


TO DO
--------------
- command line args for maximum and min image size to consider
- specify output image size
- press 'o' at any time to output image
- other options to create a squarepacked (or circlepacked) image rather than an average
- output elapsed time
